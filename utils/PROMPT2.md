Now let's modify the existing code that I provided above, to add the possibility to mark and unmark the elements in the reading list as read, use a checkbox for that. While we are at it, let's change the schema of what we store in the reading list: store each url, title, read status and favicon only once, and to each such item associate a list of timestamps when the item was added. Basically do the grouping at the save time instead of at render time.
